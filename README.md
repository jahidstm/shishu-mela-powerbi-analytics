## 📄 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Data Analytics Dashboard** designed to monitor the daily operations and performance of a hypothetical amusement park, **"Shishu Mela"**. 

Developed as part of the **Management Information System (MIS)** course at **Daffodil International University (DIU)**, this dashboard transforms raw operational data into actionable business insights using **Microsoft Power BI**.

## 🎯 Business Problem & Objectives
The management of "Shishu Mela" needed a digital solution to track their daily business activities. The primary goals of this analysis were to:

* **Track Revenue:** Identify which days and rides generate the most income.
* **Analyze Demographics:** Understand the age group and gender ratio of visitors.
* **Monitor Satisfaction:** Measure Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) to improve service quality.
* **Optimize Operations:** Spot peak days (e.g., Friday/Saturday) for better staff management.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Microsoft Power BI:** For data visualization, data modeling, and dashboard creation.
* **Microsoft Excel:** For generating the mock dataset (200+ records) using logic-based formulas.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating custom measures and column sorting.
* **Power Query:** For data cleaning and transformation.

## 🚀 Key Features & Insights

### 1. Dynamic Data Modeling
* Solved **Circular Dependency** issues in DAX to sort weekdays chronologically (Saturday to Friday) based on the business week logic, rather than alphabetical order.

### 2. Interactive Visuals
* **KPI Cards:** Displaying Total Revenue, Total Visitors, Average Age, and Ride Count.
* **Slicers:** Allows users to filter data by **Day** and **Ride Name**.
* **Gauge Chart:** Visualizing average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores.
* **Donut Chart:** Showing the Male vs. Female visitor ratio.

### 3. Revenue Analysis
* **Column Chart:** Shows that **Friday** and **Saturday** are the peak revenue days.
* **Bar Chart:** Identifies the top-performing rides contributing to the total sales.

## 📂 Dataset Description
Since real-world data was unavailable, I generated a **mock dataset** containing **200 rows** with the following attributes:
* `Date` & `Day Name`
* `Visitor Age` & `Gender`
* `Ride Name` (e.g., Nagordola, Toy Train)
* `Ticket Price`
* `Satisfaction Score` (1-5)
